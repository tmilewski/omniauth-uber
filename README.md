Patreon OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.x and supports the OAuth 2.0 server-side flow.

You may view the Patreon API documentation [here](https://www.patreon.com/portal/).

This project is a fork from [omniauth/omniauth-patreon](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-patreon), reconfigured for the Patreon API ðŸ™‚

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-patreon'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Patreon` is simply Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :patreon, ENV['PATREON_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET']
end
```

## Configuration

- `scope`: A _space separated_ list of permissions you want to request from the Patreon API (e.g: `users my-campaign`). View the Patreon API docs for [Scope](https://docs.patreon.com/#scopes). Default: `users pledges-to-me my-campaign`

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :patreon, ENV['patreon_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['patreon_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: 'campaigns pledges'
end
```

## Auth Hash

Here's an example _Auth Hash_ available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  provider: 'patreon',
  access_token: 'abc123token',
  refresh_token: 'def456token',
  expires_in: '2018-10-13T19:00:51+00:00',
  scope: 'campaign pledges'
  token_type: "Bearer"
}
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

`omniauth-patreon` is tested under 2.2.6, 2.3.3, 2.4.1, and ruby-head.

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Violations
of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch
version is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be
immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be
introduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and
should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version
Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'omniauth-patreon', '~> 1.0'
